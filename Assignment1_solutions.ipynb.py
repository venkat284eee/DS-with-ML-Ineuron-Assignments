# # Question 1:
# Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple
# of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a
# comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# In[1]:

# # Question 2:
# Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in
# the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

# In[2]:

# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
# generate a list.

# In[4]:


print("Enter sequence of comma seperated numbers.")

# Create the below pattern using nested for loop in Python.
